The global temperature has been steadily increasing over the past century.
This increase is largely attributed to human activities, such as the burning of fossil fuels.
Scientists predict that global temperatures will continue to rise in the coming decades.
This rise in global temperature could have significant consequences for the planet, including more extreme weather events and rising sea levels.
