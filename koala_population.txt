Koala populations in Australia are facing a range of threats, including habitat loss, bushfires, and disease. The Australian Koala Foundation estimates that there are less than 100,000 koalas left in the wild, and their numbers are declining. Efforts to protect koalas include habitat restoration, disease control, and public awareness campaigns.
