The koala population in Australia has been declining for years. In 2019, there were an estimated 100,000 koalas left. This is a drastic decrease from the estimated 1 million koalas in the 19th century. Recent bushfires have further impacted their numbers, leading to habitat loss and food scarcity. Conservation efforts are underway to protect and restore koala populations.
